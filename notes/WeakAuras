  -- some code
  -- The first two values passed in are the raw values set by the duration info from the trigger(s), and have not been formatted.
  -- The last 5, on the other hand values are precisely the strings that replace %p, %t, %n, %i, and %s, respectively. 
  -- Note that they have already been formatted, so trying to manipulate progress (say, by adding 5 to it) may not have the result you expect.
